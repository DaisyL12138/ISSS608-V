# 1 Overview

This take-home exercise is done based on a take-home exercise 1 submission prepared by a classmate. The peer submission will be critiqued in terms of clarity and aesthetics, and the original design will be remade using the data visualization principles and best practice learnt in Lesson 1 and 2.

The dataset used is downloaded from [Department of Statistics, Singapore](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/), and processed by RStudio `tidyverse` family of packages and visualized by `ggplot2` and its extensions.

# 2 Data Preparation

## 2.1 Installing packages and loading libraries

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## 2.2 Import data

```{r}
popdata <- read_csv("popdata.csv")
head(popdata,10)
```

## 2.3 Change the data type of 'Age' from strings to numeric

```{r}
popdata <- transform(popdata,Age=as.numeric(Age))


```

## 2.4 Group 'Age' in to 'Age_group'

```{r}
popdata<-popdata%>%
  mutate(Age_group = cut(Age, breaks = c(0,4,9,14,19,24,29,34,39,44,49,54,59,64,69,74,79,84,89),
  include.lowest = TRUE,
  include.highest=TRUE,
  labels = c("0 to 4", "5 to 9", "10 to 14", "15 to 19","20 to 24","25 to 29","30 to 34","35 to 39","40 to 44","45 to 49","50 to 54","55 to 59","60 to 64","65 to 69","70 to 74","75 to 79","80 to 84","85 to 89")
                         
                         ))
head(popdata,10)
```

## 2.5 Check the top 9 planing area with the most population

```{r}
pop=popdata %>% group_by(PA)  %>%
                    summarise(Pop = sum(Pop),
                              .groups = 'drop')
top_n(pop,9,Pop)
```

## 2.6 Filter the planing area

```{r}
popdata <-filter(popdata,PA %in% c("Bedok","Jurong West","Yishun","Punggol",'Bukit Batok',"Woodlands","Sengkang","Hougang","Choa Chu Kang"))
popdata <- popdata[!is.na(popdata$Age_group),]

```

# 3 Age-Sex Pyramid Using Trellis Display Critique and Remake

## **3.1 Critique**

The graph below is an Age-Sex Pyramid made by a classmate

![](2.png)

**Clarity**

-   The graph is generally clear in terms of x-axis labels, planning area labels and overall layout. The audience is able to gasp the general trend of population distribution of each planning area.

-   Y-axis label 'AG' is an acronym, which is vague, can be improved by using 'Age Group'. And the group name was compressed, this will bring problem for the audience.

-   Some value labels are blocked and some groups have labels but others do not.

-   The 'Column' and 'Row' should be hided.

-   The title of the graph should be bold and bigger

**Aesthetics**

-   Colors chosen are clean and easily readable to the audience.

-   The planning area labels could be more clean.

## **3.2 Remake**

```{r}
pop1 <-popdata %>% group_by(PA,Age_group,Sex)  %>%
  summarise(Pop=sum(Pop),.groups='keep')

                  
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(data=pop1, 
       aes(x=Age_group,fill=Sex,
           y = ifelse(test = Sex == "Males",
                            yes = -Pop, no = Pop))) + 
 geom_bar(stat = 'Identity',width = 0.8) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = abs, n.breaks=7,limits = max(pop1$Pop) * c(-1,1)) +
  labs(x='Age Group',y = "Population Amount") + 
  coord_flip()+
  facet_wrap(~ PA) +
  ggtitle("Age-Sex Pyramid of 9 Planning Area in Singapore") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=18,face='bold',hjust = 0.5),
          panel.grid.major =element_blank(), 
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_blank(),
          axis.title =  element_text(size=12,face = "bold"),
          axis.text.y =   element_text(hjust = 1, 
                                        size=10),  
                                        plot.margin=unit(rep(1,4),'cm'))+
  geom_text(aes(label=Pop),
            position = position_dodge2(width = 0.5, padding=0.3,preserve = 'single'), 
            vjust = 0.6, hjust = 0.5,size=3)
